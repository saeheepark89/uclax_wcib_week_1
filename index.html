    <h3>Welcome to SaeHee's page!</h3>
    <p>
      Hello! I am excited to learn how to code with the classmates at UCLA Extension! </br>I'm working with an impressive iMac that is going on 10 years strong, running on MacOS High Sierra.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first week's assignment, I was able to follow along the video clips to get my local and hosting environment up and running. </br>It was challenging at first, like learning a new language, but taking notes between clips and being able to rewind them definitely helped!
    <h4>Below are the three websites I enjoy.</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/" title="NewYorkTimes" target="_blank">The New York Times</a>: What an interesting time we are living in... tying to stay up to date with the world, some days it can be overwhelming though.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/" title="YouTube" target="_blank">YouTube</a>: Quarantine has me revisiting old hobbies and trying new things. Playing piano, yoga, cooking... to name a few.</li>
      <li><a href="https://brenebrown.com/" title="BreneBrown" target="_blank">Brene Brown</a>: From her books to podcast, she provides great advice on power of courage and vulnerability. </li>
    </ul>
